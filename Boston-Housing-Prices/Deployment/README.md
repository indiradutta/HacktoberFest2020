# Boston Housing Price

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Bostonâ€™s suburbs. The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregate information about 14 features of homes from various suburbs located in Boston. Here's a Web App that allows the user to input the required features to get the estimated price.

# Steps for using the Web App
- Setting up the Python Environment with the dependencies:

        pip install -r Requirements.txt

- Cloning the Repository: 

        git clone https://github.com/srijarkoroy/Boston-Housing-Price.git
- Entering The directory: 

        cd Boston-Housing-Price
- Running the Web App:

        streamlit run app.py
- Stopping the web app from the terminal:

        Ctrl+C
